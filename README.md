# ✅ Best Combo (High ROI for SDE Prep)

1. **Programming Foundations** → Harvard CS50 (edX)
2. **DSA Specialization** → UC San Diego (Coursera)
3. **System Design & Architecture** → Alberta (Coursera)
4. **Projects/Full-Stack Dev** → Full-Stack (Coursera/edX)
5. **Interview Prep** → Meta Interview Prep (Coursera)
